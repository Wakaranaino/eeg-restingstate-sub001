# EEG Resting-State Analysis: Multi-Subject ICA, PSD, and Bandpower Topomap

This repository provides a fully automated MATLAB pipeline for preprocessing and analyzing resting-state EEG data across multiple subjects using EEGLAB. It was originally developed for [OpenNeuro dataset: ds004504](https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds004504.v1.0.8) and has been generalized from single-subject scripts to a multi-subject batch framework.

## Overview

**Goal**:  Extract clean spectral features (Theta, Alpha, Beta) from EEG recordings and visualize scalp-wide distributions, while supporting multi-subject normalization, quality control (QC), and group-level summaries.

**Pipeline**:
1. Load .set EEG dataset
2. Automated artifact reduction via clean_rawdata()
3. Apply low-pass filter at 40 Hz
4. Re-reference to average and interpolate missing channels (optional, spherical)
5. Run ICA (Infomax)
6. Component classification with ICLabel
7. Auto-reject artifactual components (e.g., blinks, muscle, ECG)
8. Compute PSD matrix via spectopo()
9. Generate PSD plots and scalp maps via pop_spectopo()
10. Normalize bandpower within each subject (proportional to total power)
11. Log QC metrics (ICs rejected, bandpower means, interpolated channels) to a master CSV and per-subject log
12. Save all outputs to organized subject-level folders under /outputs/

***New in Version 2.1 (June 9, 2025)***
- Channel interpolation added (spherical method)
- Logs interpolated channels per subject (mat + QC txt)
- Compatible with group-level topomap averaging
- Visual red-flag overlay removed (replaced with text logs for clarity)
